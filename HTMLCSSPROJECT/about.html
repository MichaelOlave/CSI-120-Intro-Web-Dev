                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>T.A.C.O was created to solve a critical problem facing insurance agencies: the time-consuming and error-prone process of manually processing commission statements from multiple carriers.</p>

                <p>Every month, agencies receive commission statements from dozens of insurance carriers, each with their own unique format and structure. Processing these statements manually to determine which agents earned what commissions can take hours or even days of work. We built T.A.C.O to automate this entire workflow, allowing agencies to focus on what they do bestâ€”serving their clients and growing their business.</p>
